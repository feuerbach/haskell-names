* Relax Cabal dependency constraint to include Cabal-1.14

Version 0.3
-----------

This release brings support for record puns and wildcards.

### Interface file format changes

For field selectors, the new field `constructors` is added. It contains a list
of constructors that contain that field.

### API changes

* The `sv_constructors` field is added to `SymSelector`
* Add `Language.Haskell.Names.SyntaxUtils.stringToName`
* The class `GetBound` is moved to a new module,
  `Language.Haskell.Names.GetBound`. Its method, `getBound`, now has a new
  argument, the global symbol table
* `NameInfo` got two more constructors to annotate wildcards,
  `RecPatWildcard` and `RecExpWildcard`
* `Scope` now has a new field of type `WcNames`, which can be accessed
  through the `wcNames` lens. This is needed for record wildcards
  resolution.
* Add field selectors to `GName`
* Don't export `GName` and `OrigName` from `GlobalSymbolTable`

-------------

* Fix a bug where global symbols were annotated as local

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Restore compatibility with Cabal 1.16

Dummy release to force rebuild on hackage (now that haskell-src-exts 1.14 is
released).
